# Micro Editor on Replit

This Repl lets you use the [Micro Editor](https://micro-editor.github.io)
in Replit.

To open the editor, open a new shell.

## Multiplayer

If you wanna write in the same editor with someone else (why though),
instead of opening a shell, open the console.

## Help

If you ever need help with Micro, press Ctrl+G. This will
popup a help markdown document, containing instructions
and other useful usage information.

## Closing Micro

To exit Micro, press Ctrl+Q. Note that this will close the current
pane, and only close Micro if this is the last open pane. You can
also press Ctrl+E and type `quit` to do the same thing.

## Running shell commands

To access the shell, either use Ctrl+B to run a single command or
open the shell tool on the bottom left of the Replit editor, and
then quit Micro. Once it quits, you should have a normal Bash shell.
